# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## A webpage featuring pre-work notes



This project was created as a means of storing important information learned in the pre-work study modules. By listing the relevant code and bullet pointing relevant information learned through the pre-work, there is now a record of what has been learned on the course. 

During this project I learned how to use GIT, HTML, CSS and javascript together to create the frame, style and interactivity of a study guide.



## Installation

## Usage

The study guide is used by bootcamp students as a way of both documenting and revising the information learned throughout the bootcamp. It is an interactive approach to learning, with console messages suggesting what should be studied first.

Using HTML and a CSS style sheet, I changed the colours of the study guide to suit my personal preference. Values such as size of text, spacing on page and colour are all adjustable.
